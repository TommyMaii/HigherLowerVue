To use the application just download it and then 
Run the Index.JS in the HigherLowerApi folder to start the backend
Then to open the frontend write npm run dev in the terminal while inside the HigherLowerClient folder.

This project also uses a .env file for database and steamkey variables. Just replace them with your own .env file or just replace it directly.
